This program is a trainer for No Limit Texas Hold Em'. When the site is opened the user will 
be prompted with a random poker hand and given the choice to "raise" or "fold", if the user chooses
the correct option their streak will increase until they get answer wrong. The player can choose different
positions to study and refer to the dropdown menu to see a chart of correct solutions.
